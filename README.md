# FYP: Paralinguistic Speech Analyzer

Honour's thesis project for Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Systems at Monash University.

Extracts paralinguistc features from speech recordings. Paralinguistic (or suprasegmental) features include pitch, timing, and stress. 
*How* people speak, rather than *what* they say. 

Paralinguistic features serve multiple purposes: they are channels which convey information about transitory emotions, about stable speaker traits,
and as "punctuation" for speech.

This code extracts several features: pauses (via segmentation), pitch (and pitch variation), and combines these to detect instances of "up-talk"
or high rising terminal.
